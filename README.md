### intrxx

Just a guy looking to build performant projects, understand memory, good architecture and ultimately develop and contribute to great games (mostly arpg, btw).

Bonuses
* My [Portfolio](https://intrxx.github.io/) that I seriously need to work on
* [Personal Unreal Engine Wiki](https://github.com/intrxx/PersonalUnrealEngineWiki) that I may or may not contribute to once per few months
* My [Steam Profile](https://steamcommunity.com/id/intrxx/), where I should probably spend less time
