<h3 align="left">About me</h3>
<p>I'm a 4th-year IT Science Game Programming student at the University of Silesia and an aspiring Unreal Engine C++ programmer. I mainly focus on Gameplay Programming, UI, and a little bit of AI, but still am familiar with scripting in Blueprints and a little bit of Level Design. I love to learn new things about the engine and follow good practices.</p>
